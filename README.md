# Password Generator

## Overview

This is a simple command-line application written in Go that generates strong and secure passwords. It allows users to specify the length of the password they desire, and then generates a random password containing a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Go installed on your system. You can download and install it from [the official Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

Run the application:
​```
go run main.go 
​```

Follow the prompts to enter the desired length of the password.

Once you enter the desired length, the generated password will be displayed on the console.
